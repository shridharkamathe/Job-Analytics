# InstaHyre Job Skills Analysis and Webpage

This repository contains a project that involves analyzing job skills data from the InstaHyre job portal and creating a webpage to display a summary of job skills. The project utilizes Python, Jupyter Notebook, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and HTML.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was obtained by scraping and cleaning the InstaHyre website. The dataset contains information about job skills, including skills like Python, SQL, Excel, and various other programming languages.

The cleaned dataset is stored in an Excel file and used for further analysis and visualization.

## Analysis

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Web Scraping and Cleaning:** The InstaHyre website was scraped using Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python. The data obtained was then cleaned using Pandas to remove any inconsistencies or irrelevant information.

2. **Data Analysis:** After cleaning the dataset, various data analysis techniques were applied. This includes creating pivot tables to summarize the job skills data. The analysis provides insights into the total job openings, locations with the most jobs, and the most common positions for job openings.

3. **Webpage Creation:** A webpage was created using HTML to display the summary of job skills. Users can enter a skill, such as Python, SQL, Excel, or other languages, and the webpage will display relevant information. This includes the total job openings, the location with the most jobs related to the skill, and the most common positions for job openings.

## Repository Structure
